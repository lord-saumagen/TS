#TS

This project is a collection of some TypeScript libraries which I wrote. Most of them are reprogrammed modules which are already available in some other javascript libraries. But I don't like that plain javascript libraries which often enough come with a bad coding style. I have the hope and vision that there will come more libraries which are written in TypeScript in the first place. My hope is, that this will bring a more professional coding style to the javascript community.

The first module which I created is a LINQ implementation in TypeScript. I'm a great fan of LINQ in C#, so that was an natural choice to start with. There is more information about this project at the project page available.

##Prerequisites

In order to use the files from that project, you need to install the TypeScript compiler. You will find all you need at the TypeScript project page.

##Usage

If you want to use some or all of the modules I wrote in you own TypeScript project, you must download the corresponding TypeScrpt files and copy to your project directory. Make sure that they get compiled with your own code and that's it. If you use Visual Studio together with the "*TypeScript Tools for Visual Studio*", you don't even have to bother how to compile your TypeScript files. You will find that tools at the '*Visual Studio Gallery*'.

Visual Studio in combination with the TypeScript tools for Visual Studio is the most advanced TypeScript development setup available today. If you once experienced the full power of that dynamic duo, you will never want to miss them.
