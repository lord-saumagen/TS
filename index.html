        <h2>Preface</h2>
        This library brings the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx" target="_blank">LINQ</a> extensions to TypeScript. 
        <br />
        <br />
        From a programmers perspective, LINQ was one of the most exciting .NET framework extensions in the past 10 years.
        Suddenly you got rid of the awkward SQL query languages in it&#39;s different flavours, which had in common to scatter all over
        your code and tiers. They were also annoyingly compiler resistent and blew always in your face when you least expected it.
        With LINQ that all came to an end and it turned out that LINQ was also a swiss knife for every problem which has to deal with<br />
        collections, semi structured or structured data in any way.<br />
        <br />
        Time went by and javascript went into the spotlight of every web programmer. To be honest, javascript was always part of the
        job, but every OOP programmer has at least an ambivalent relationship to javascript. That programming language has 5 times
        more desing flaws than instructions. Even well established javascript libraries, which claim for themselfe to be professionel,
        look more like a result of a hacker contest than professionel code. But all attempts to establish a better language for client-side 
        programming have failed. Even worse, the language itself evolves with the speed of continental plates. There is no hope that
        the language will reach a mature state in the next 5000 years. Those which are responsible
        for the language specification 
        have also no intention to get rid of the ages old errors. Offically because they won&#39;t brake
        backward compatibility.<br />
        <br />
        Who ever came up with that crap shall burn in hell for eterniyt.
        <br />
        <br />
        But then came <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg</a>, my personal hero and inventor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript.</a><br />
        <br />
        He showed us a way out of the misery. He created a language which looks and feels almost like a real programming language.
        You do not longer have to deal with all the crap and hacks and well known errors to keep your javascript programs running. 
        Now you can program your script code just
        like you always did in C#. You also get full intellisense and error messages at compile
        time. At least when you use visual studio for
        your programming task.
        <br />
        <br />
        But how could Anders Hejlsberg establish a new cliend-side script language when all others (even google and god) failed. The
        simple answer is:<br />
        <br />
        &quot;Because he didn&#39;t even try.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        TypeScript code compiles ( or transpiles, if you like ) to javascript. This way your browser won&#39;t even notice that you are
        already a lightyear ahead of the lame script engine restriction. Someday, somebody should investigate why one of the
        worst programming languages was the only thing the browser vendors could agree on, during the dark ages of the
        browser war in the last millenium.
        <br />
        <br />
        An now, it comes all together.<br />
        <br />
        That&#39;s the part where I come into play. Anders did a great job and gave us lambda expressions, inheritance, something like
        a type system, typed function arguments, access modifiers and much much more. All that stuff you always wanted to have in
        javascript but didn&#39;t dare to ask for. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t have time to implement LINQ yet.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may alredy have noticed that I like LINQ and have to deal with javascript more an more. This gave birth to the idea to
        reprogram the LINQ extension in TypeScript. I&#39;m aware that there are already other libraries doing the same job.
        The most popular would be the one called <a href="https://linqjs.codeplex.com/">&#39;ling.js&#39;</a> which is hosted on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>. Unfortunately the code is plain javascript with
        an additional TypeScript declaration file (&quot;d.ts&quot;). Those &quot;d.ts&quot; files work much like header files in C or C++. They introduce the
        library functions to TypeScript so that you can use them from within your TypeScript code. But I had a different vision. I would
        like to see more libraries written in TypeScript in the first place. That way, the &quot;d.ts&quot; files become obsolet and those which
        are not enlightened can still use your code, because after compiling it is plain javascript for them.<br />
        <br />
        After all,&nbsp; I must say it was fun to write the library. I had already lost my hope and didn&#39;t belive that there will one day fun
        in javascript programming. But the great visionary and master of superb programming languages disabused me.
        I take a deep bow in front of him and I hope you will have as much fun in using my library as I had in writing it.<br />

      <div id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        This library is a reprogrammed version of the default C# LINQ library in TypeScript.<br />
        Below is a link to the description of the standard query operators as they are defined by microsoft:<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397896.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397896.aspx</a><br />
        <br />
        There are other libraries available which offer the same functionality as this one. They may even be faster or offer
        more extensions than this one. But as far as I can tell, they were designed with different design goals in mind. Even if the 
        design
        goals are not explicitly named, you can tell hat by looking at their code.<br />
        <br />
        First of all, those libraries which I know are all written in plain javascript. But I would like to see more libraries and
        programs written in TypeScript in the first place. So I started my own project.<br />
        <br />
        Second, I like a <a href="https://cleancoders.com/">"Clean Code"</a> coding style. Unfortunately most javascript programmers don't bother for a clean coding style.
        The prefer the "Hacker Style" which makes it always a nighmare if it comes to a situation where you have to debug through their
        code.<br />
        <br />
        Third, I always vote for robustness over speed. All my functions implement an expensive parameter checking and fail gracefulley
        by throwing meaningfull exceptions.<br />
        <br />
        To make my point clear. There are faster implementations and there are implementations which offer a lot more extensions. But if
        you need a robust and well designed implementation your are at the right place.

        <br />
        <br />
        All my classes and functions got a code comment which shows up in the editor during typing. At leas if you use visual studio
        for development. That feature makes it a lot more easier to write code in javascript then you might expect. Check it out and you
        will never want to miss it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even with that design goals in mind and extensive testing, there might be errors in this library. For that reason I would like to hear
        from you
        when you find one.

        <h2>LINQ</h2>
        All classes, modules and interfaces which belong to the 'TS.Linq' namespace can be found in the corresponding subdirectory called 'Linq'.<br />
        <br />
        The extension functions are all defined in the 'TS.Linq.Extensions' module. The corresponding source file is the 'Extensions.ts' file in
        the
        'Linq' directory. The module functions resemble the public static functions defined in C#.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most of the extension functions are also bound to the 'TS.Linq.Enumerable' class which you can find in file 'Enumerable.ts'. This way you can
        use the fluid interface for the LINQ extensions which you may already know from C#.<br />
        <br />
